      <h4>Day 1: </h4>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog about camping in Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand! 

Mount Cook National Park is a stunning destination for camping and hiking enthusiasts. Located in the South Island of New Zealand, this park is home to the highest mountain in the country, Aoraki/Mount Cook, which stands at 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) tall. The park features glaciers, alpine meadows, and turquoise lakes, making it a perfect place for outdoor adventures.

Camping in Mount Cook National Park is an experience that you won't forget. The park offers several campgrounds, each with its own unique features. Whether you prefer to camp in a forest, by a river, or near a glacier, you'll find the perfect spot to pitch your tent.

One of the best campgrounds in the park is the White Horse Hill Campground. Located at the base of Aoraki/Mount Cook, this campground offers stunning views of the mountain and the Hooker Valley. The campground has basic facilities, including toilets and water taps, and is a great starting point for many hiking trails.

The Hooker Valley Track is a must-do hike while camping in Mount Cook National Park. This trail is a 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) round trip and takes about three hours to complete. The trail is relatively easy and suitable for all levels of fitness. Along the way, you can admire the Hooker Glacier Lake, which is a beautiful turquoise color, and the majestic Aoraki/Mount Cook.

            <h4>Day 2: </h4>
            <p>
Hi again! Another great hiking trail is the Mueller Hut Route. This trail is more challenging than the Hooker Valley Track but offers even more stunning views. The trail takes you to the Mueller Hut, which sits at an elevation of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet), and offers panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and glaciers. The hike is 5.2 kilometers (3.2 miles) one way and takes about four to six hours to complete.

                    This was my last day at mount cook, so I went for a more adventurous camping experience. I tried backcountry camping in Mount Cook National Park. The park has several backcountry campsites that are accessible only by hiking. These campsites offer a more secluded experience and allow you to fully immerse yourself in the park's wilderness.
Camping in Mount Cook National Park is an unforgettable experience that offers breathtaking views and endless outdoor adventures. Whether you're an experienced hiker or a beginner, the park has something for everyone. So pack your tent and hiking boots and get ready to explore one of New Zealand's most beautiful national parks!
